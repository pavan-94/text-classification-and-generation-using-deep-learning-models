# text-classification-and-generation-using-deep-learning-models
Introduction:
This report is subjected to various models of deep learning for sentiment analysis and language generation. For this purpose, the dataset used is movie reviews from IMDB which is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews. The dataset consists of two columns namely ‘reviews’ and ‘sentiment’ and a total of 50,000 rows. Google colab is used for coding as the free GPU provided by Google is very effective and helps in fast training of the models. The dataset is downloaded and uploaded to google drive in order to use the data in colab. 

Problem Statement: Classification of IMDB review into two classes namely ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ using various text classification models.
Problem Statement: Using LSTM and n-grams to predict next character in order to generate sentences.
Two separate notebooks are created one with Part 1 and first section of Part 2 and second notebook consists of last section of Part2
